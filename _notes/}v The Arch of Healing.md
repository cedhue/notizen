What do you hope would change? Chances are that if you click on such a webinar, that there is something that you want to change (either external or internal).

My first answer is: 
- I want to get over what happened when I fell ill and almost died from it.
- I want to be healthy again, fit, have power and be (physically) strong.
- I want to be able to swim and surf and run.
- My sense of life, purpose, drive, joy, aliveness.
- Wanting to find repair.

Reestablishing relationship with a parent:
- Finding it difficult to bring up things with one's parent.
- When a child cuts off the relationship with their parent it is because they actually want that closeness

Feelings that are associated: Overwhelm, Feeling of being out of control

Even when it comes from a biological or physical reason, a toolkit for dealing with trauma can be useful.

Tony Kavanaugh Johnson: "It's not enough to merely teach people skills, what you need is to bring the child back into a place of autonomy"

Traumatized children recreate moments of abused in attempt to recreate the moment but they try to be in control this time.

It's about reedeming the past, not just leaving the past behind, recapturing destiny.

Gotman's Institute: Monitoring couples for 24 hours, tracking their conversations, heart rates, stress levels. They created a model that predicts with 96% accuracy if the couple will stay together or divorce, also when. 

-> Conflict resolution model, that can create a bond of trust

Love and repair comes from trust, and trust is understand from where both people were coming from. 

Internal Family Systems: Idea that one person has several parts (one who wants to go to the gym, one who wants to go back to school, one who really loves their partner, another one that feels lonely) -> it's like a couple within oneself, different part in disagreement

**Idea: What if the Gotman's tools could work for the internal parts of a person?**

It's not just that people 

There's a part of you that is still trapped back at the moment when the traumatic event occured

there is a part that holds the wound, the emotion, the intensity, the fear and the terror of everything that happend

and that part still lives in you within the implicit memory (Frank Anderson)

explicit memory <-> implicit memory (what is absorbed, impression upon the nervous system), what happened emotionally

when we experience something traumatic it's not just stored explicitly but also taken into the body (= implicitly), the wound is held in the body. 

The feelings and sensation often feel like they don't make sense at all. We can't make sense why it still affects us, even if we consciously understand that we are not in the situation anymore.

Why can't I just commit? Why can I just feel normal?

There's parts within the subconscious who are also experiencing and animating these different mood-states. They have a story to tell.

**Strategies that we lean into when we feel overhelming emotions:

Different strategies of control and avoidance (one axis) that can be expressed either externally and internally 

Control:

- self criticism (Why can't you just be normal?) -> trying to assert control
- I need you to X so I can feel okay (losing one's temper, criticism of over people, defensiveness, manipulation, but also people pleasing, appeasement) -> another form of control (although it doesn't feel like control)

Avoidance (when control doesn't work, we move into one of these)

- distraction, substance use, changing the subject (denial) -> when we can't think
- I need you to get away from me (walking out one somebody during an argument, also ghosting)

I need to feel okay.
I need to get myself to be X in order to feel okay.

We start in this first world of overwhelm:

![[Pasted image 20220725234844.png]]

When all of these things dont' work and overwhelm is getting to strong we get into these Threat responses:

hyperarousal and numbing, also internal and external:

switch from hyperarousal to hypoarousal -> switch from fight or fligt to freeze response (feeling blank, numb, etc.)

domain on the right is common in sexual abuse, chronic neglect and violence (feeling divorced from one's body)

**How do we get out of this: calming down**

move into calming, relaxation, grounding (clear link with the neuroscience: Hippocampus and frontal cortex need to get back online in order to be able to integrate the experience, to think clearly)

goal: reprogramming the brain

then: enter in conversation with the self-critical parts / parts that are trying to control the external world to be able to feel okay, because when this happens there is something within you that needs to feel safe (which only oneself can do)

Trauma is being robbed of that agency. Way out is reclaiming it. Our job is to heal not to protect, not to avoid trigger, but to strengthen and equip.

How do you do that: engage in conversation, dive into the labels, opinions

Healing from trauma is about building back trust between you and the part of you that hold traumatic wounds (that holds all the pain, the wound).
